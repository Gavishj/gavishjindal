As of 15 August 2025, I’ve turned 19 years old. It’s crazy how much faster time seems to move with every new year.  
To mark the occasion, I wanted to reflect on my favorite ideas and principles that I’ve picked up and developed over the last 19 years.  

I went through my diaries, stories, and notes with an eye out for anything that I’m particularly passionate about. These could be ideas, principles, insights, advice, quotes, concepts — really anything. There’s no explicit criteria, as long as it had some significant impact on my current view of the world.  

I don’t know if any or all of these principles will resonate with anyone else (or even with me when I’m older), but looking back, they’ve had a huge impact on me in the present. We’re always growing, adapting, transforming; nothing is stagnant. Still, these ideas helped shape who I am today. To me, that’s worth something, and worth sharing.  

So here we go: **19 favourite principles from the last 19 years**  

---

1. As outcome bias says, results don’t matter — input and performance do.  
2. Thoughts create the future — what you want to happen might actually will.  
3. There are always more options than the ones you’re offered.  
4. When people tell you you shouldn’t do something — maybe that’s when you should.  
5. Goals are artificial; they change.  
6. You NEED some time alone — take a couple hours to resonate and introspect.  
7. Breakdowns can be important; they release us from an undesirable state.  
8. Take mental health just as seriously as physical health.  
9. The body you’re given is a blessing — don’t take it for granted.  
10. Therapy doesn’t fix you; it helps you realise you need to help yourself.  
11. You’re not living on an island — human connection is essential.  
12. When it’s all over, you’ll remember the people you were with more than the experiences themselves.  
13. People do business with people they like. Even if it starts professionally, get personal as soon as possible.  
14. Saying no doesn’t make you an outcast.  
15. Be the smartest in the room without letting others know you are.  
16. Capability is used as an excuse — 99% of the time you can do it if you work hard enough.  
17. Double down on what works well.  
18. Do it alone — don’t wait for a running mate if you don’t have one.  
19. Education is more important than the current generation thinks.

That’s it for now. Who knows — maybe I’ll come back with 20 ideas next year.  

Birthdays are kind of a funny thing. You always wake up expecting something, anything, to be different. But it never is. Time goes on, and we do everything we can to make the most of it in our own unique way.
