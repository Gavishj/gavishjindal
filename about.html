    <h1>Hey, I’m Gavish 👋🏼</h1>

    <p>
      Born <strong><span id="daysOld">…</span> days</strong> ago.  
      I’m an undergraduate business student in my 2nd year, exploring data-driven learning and why anything & everything happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m at my best when connecting ideas across psychology, decision-making, and business.  
      This means understanding how people think, applying data to uncover insights, and experimenting with ways to improve choices and outcomes.  
      If I’m not working on something academic, you might find me <a href="reading.html">reading</a> a self-help book, 
      <a href="blog.html">writing</a> something new, or spamming songs on Spotify.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to get in touch, I’m most responsive on <a href="mailto:gavishjindal2006@gmail.com">email</a>,  
      and you’ll occasionally find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavishjindal/">LinkedIn</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Previously</h2>
    <p>
      Most recently, I attended the LSE Summer School, studying <em>The Science and Art of Decision-Making</em>, finishing with an A+.<br>
      Before that, I was captain of my high school football team, Byte Club (President & Ambassador), Mind Haven (Mental Health Club), and Interact Club (RYLA delegate).<br>
      Now at O.P. Jindal Global University, I’m pursuing Business Administration while being involved in Entrepreneurship Club, Rotaract Club, and Kasauli Tigers (Jindal League).
